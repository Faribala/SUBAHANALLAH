## 1. USS Thresher (SSN-593) — United States

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Class** | Permit (Thresher) |
| **Displacement** | 3,210 t surfaced / 3,420 t submerged |
| **Length** | 85 m (279 ft) |
| **Reactor** | 1 × Westinghouse S5W PWR |
| **Date Lost** | 10 April 1963 |
| **Casualties** | 129 (all hands — crew + shipyard personnel) |
| **Depth** | ~2,560 m (8,400 ft), 350 km east of Cape Cod |

**Cause:** During deep-diving tests, a silver-brazed pipe joint likely ruptured in the engine room. The resulting flooding shorted electrical systems and triggered a reactor scram. The emergency ballast blow system failed due to ice formation in high-pressure air lines. The submarine exceeded crush depth and imploded.

**Current State:** Wreckage lies in five major sections on the seabed. Not salvaged. Nuclear fuel remains intact; environmental monitoring shows no significant radioactive release.

**Key Danger:** The reactor and its fuel remain on the ocean floor. Periodic Navy monitoring confirms no measurable contamination above background levels.

## 2. USS Scorpion (SSN-589) — United States

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Class** | Skipjack |
| **Displacement** | 2,930 t surfaced / 3,124 t submerged |
| **Length** | 76.7 m (252 ft) |
| **Reactor** | 1 × S5W PWR |
| **Date Lost** | 22 May 1968 |
| **Casualties** | 99 (all hands) |
| **Depth** | ~3,000 m (9,800 ft), 740 km SW of the Azores |

**Cause:** Unknown — the Navy's various investigations remain inconclusive. Leading theories include torpedo battery malfunction causing an internal explosion, a hot-running torpedo homing back on the sub, or structural failure. The hull imploded at ~470 m before falling to the ocean floor.

**Current State:** Wreck rests on the seabed in the North Atlantic. The hull is broken into major sections; the engine room telescoped 15 m forward from the implosion. Not salvaged.

**Key Danger:** Contains one nuclear reactor and two Mark 45 nuclear-tipped torpedoes (plutonium/uranium warheads). Navy monitoring indicates the nuclear fuel remains intact and the warhead cores have likely corroded into dense, insoluble material settled in sediment. No excess uranium detected.

## 3. K-8 — Soviet Union

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Class** | November (Project 627A) |
| **Displacement** | 3,065 t surfaced / 4,750 t submerged |
| **Length** | 107.4 m (352 ft) |
| **Reactor** | 2 × 70 MW VM-A PWR |
| **Date Lost** | 12 April 1970 |
| **Casualties** | 52 (of 125 crew; 73 survived) |
| **Depth** | ~4,680 m (15,350 ft), Bay of Biscay, 490 km NW of Spain |

**Cause:** Simultaneous fires in two compartments (III and VII) during the "Ocean-70" naval exercise on 8 April 1970. Both reactors were shut down. After being ordered to evacuate and then re-board for towing, 52 crewmen died from carbon monoxide poisoning and flooding when the submarine sank in rough seas during the tow.

**Current State:** Rests on the Atlantic Ocean floor with four nuclear torpedoes on board. Not salvaged.

**Key Danger:** Contains two nuclear reactors and four nuclear torpedoes at extreme depth. The great depth makes salvage impractical.

## 4. K-219 — Soviet Union

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Class** | Yankee I (Project 667A) |
| **Displacement** | 7,891 t surfaced / 9,449 t submerged |
| **Length** | 129.8 m (426 ft) |
| **Reactor** | 2 × 90 MW OK-700 PWR |
| **Date Lost** | 6 October 1986 |
| **Casualties** | 4 (of 120 crew; 116 survived) |
| **Depth** | ~6,000 m (20,000 ft), 1,090 km NE of Bermuda |

**Cause:** On 3 October 1986, seawater leaked into missile silo No. 6 and reacted with liquid rocket fuel, causing an explosion and fire. Two crew killed outright; a third died of toxic gas. Seaman Sergei Preminin gave his life manually inserting reactor control rods into both reactors, preventing a meltdown. The submarine surfaced but could not be towed and sank on 6 October.

**Current State:** Rests on the Hatteras Abyssal Plain with its full complement of nuclear weapons (16 ballistic missile tubes). Not salvaged.

**Key Danger:** Contains two reactors and 16 nuclear ballistic missiles. The extreme depth (~6 km) makes recovery effectively impossible. Long-term corrosion risks to nuclear material containment.

## 5. K-278 Komsomolets — Soviet Union

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Class** | Mike (Project 685) — only one built |
| **Displacement** | 5,750 t surfaced / 8,000 t submerged |
| **Length** | 117.5 m (385 ft) |
| **Reactor** | 1 × 190 MW OK-650b-3 PWR |
| **Date Lost** | 7 April 1989 |
| **Casualties** | 42 (of 69 crew; 27 survived) |
| **Depth** | ~1,680 m (5,510 ft), Barents Sea, SW of Bear Island |

**Cause:** A short circuit caused fire in an engineering compartment at 335 m depth. Fire spread through cable penetrations despite watertight doors. The reactor scrammed; propulsion was lost. The submarine surfaced via emergency ballast blow but continued burning, fed by compressed air lines. After five hours on the surface, it sank. Many crew died of hypothermia in 2°C water.

**Current State:** Lies on the Barents Sea floor. Hull fractures have been sealed with a jelly-like sealant (expected to last 20–30 years). A 2019 expedition found caesium-137 leaking from a ventilation pipe at up to 800 Bq/L, though dilution prevents environmental threat.

**Key Danger:** Contains one reactor and two nuclear-warhead torpedoes. Plutonium leakage was detected in 1994, leading to sealing operations. The wreck is described as a long-term radioactive hazard. Norwegian and Russian agencies monitor it annually.

## 6. K-27 — Soviet Union (Scuttled)

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Class** | November variant (Project 645) — only one built |
| **Displacement** | 3,420 t surfaced / 4,380 t submerged |
| **Length** | 109.8 m (360 ft) |
| **Reactor** | 2 × VT-1 lead-bismuth liquid-metal-cooled reactors (~73 MW each) |
| **Date Scuttled** | 6 September 1982 |
| **Casualties** | 9 eventually died of radiation exposure (from 1968 reactor accident) |
| **Depth** | ~33 m (108 ft), Stepovoy Bay, Kara Sea, off Novaya Zemlya |

**Cause:** The submarine's experimental liquid-metal-cooled reactors were plagued by problems. In 1968, ~20% of a reactor core ruptured, releasing fuel and fission products into the liquid-metal coolant. Nine crew received fatal radiation doses. Decommissioned in 1979, the reactor compartment was sealed with furfuryl alcohol and bitumen, then the sub was deliberately scuttled in 1982.

**Current State:** Rests in very shallow water (33 m) in the Kara Sea — a violation of IAEA guidelines requiring nuclear vessels be scuttled at ≥3,000 m depth. The reactor compartment remains sealed.

**Key Danger:** Shallow depth makes it vulnerable to disturbance and corrosion. The liquid-metal-cooled reactor fuel is fused with the coolant and cannot be dismantled conventionally. Russia has plans (announced 2020) to raise K-27 and K-159 by 2030, but recovery cost and technical complexity remain high.

## 7. K-429 — Soviet Union (Raised)

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Class** | Charlie I (Project 670A) |
| **Displacement** | 4,369 t surfaced / 5,588 t submerged |
| **Length** | 104 m (341 ft) |
| **Reactor** | OK-350 with VM-4 core, 89.2 MW |
| **Date Sunk** | 24 June 1983 (first); 13 September 1985 (second) |
| **Casualties** | 16 (first sinking); 0 (second sinking) |
| **Depth** | ~39 m (first sinking), Sarannaya Bay, Kamchatka |

**Cause (first sinking):** Ordered to sea despite being mid-overhaul with an inexperienced pickup crew, K-429 attempted a test dive. Open ventilation valves (left from shipyard work) caused catastrophic flooding of forward compartments. Confused operators wasted emergency air. 14 crew died instantly; 2 more during rescue.

**Cause (second sinking):** Sank at her moorings from flooding, 13 September 1985.

**Current State:** Raised after both sinkings and decommissioned in 1987. No longer on the seabed.

**Key Danger:** No ongoing hazard — the submarine was recovered both times.

## 8. K-141 Kursk — Russia

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Class** | Oscar II (Project 949A) |
| **Displacement** | 13,400–16,400 t (surfaced–submerged figures vary) |
| **Length** | 154 m (505 ft) |
| **Reactor** | 2 × OK-650b PWR |
| **Date Lost** | 12 August 2000 |
| **Casualties** | 118 (all hands) |
| **Depth** | ~108 m (354 ft), Barents Sea, 135 km off Severomorsk |

**Cause:** During a naval exercise, high-test peroxide (HTP) propellant leaked through a faulty weld in a Type 65 torpedo casing. The initial explosion (equivalent to 100–250 kg TNT) ruptured the torpedo room. 135 seconds later, the heat detonated 5–7 additional torpedo warheads in an explosion equivalent to 3–7 tons of TNT, registering 4.2 on the Richter scale. The blast destroyed the first three compartments, killing or incapacitating all but 23 of the 118 aboard.

**Current State:** In 2001, the entire hull minus the bow was raised by Dutch consortium Mammoet/Smit International and towed to Severomorsk for analysis. The bow was destroyed with explosives in 2002. Reactor compartment towed to Sayda Bay; fuel removed by early 2003. **Salvaged and dismantled.**

**Key Danger:** No ongoing environmental hazard — the submarine was recovered, defueled, and dismantled.

## 9. K-159 — Russia

| Detail | Value |
|---|---|
| **Class** | November (Project 627A) |
| **Displacement** | ~3,065 t surfaced / ~4,750 t submerged (November-class) |
| **Length** | ~107 m (352 ft) |
| **Reactor** | 2 × VM-A PWR |
| **Date Lost** | 30 August 2003 |
| **Casualties** | 9 (of 10 salvage crew; 1 survived) |
| **Depth** | ~200 m, Barents Sea |

**Cause:** Decommissioned in 1989 and left to rust at Gremikha for 14 years with fuel likely still aboard. In 2003, spot-welded 1940s-era pontoons were attached to keep the deteriorated hull afloat for towing to a shipyard. During the tow, a squall ripped away a pontoon in the early morning of 30 August, and the submarine sank.

**Current State:** Rests on the Barents Sea floor at ~200 m depth with an estimated 800 kg of spent nuclear fuel containing ~5.3 GBq of radionuclides. Not yet salvaged.

**Key Danger:** The hull had "the strength of foil" before sinking and continues to deteriorate. Spent fuel remains aboard in un-defueled reactors. Russia issued a 2020 presidential decree to raise K-159 and K-27, with an estimated cost of US $330 million. A special salvage vessel may need to be built.
