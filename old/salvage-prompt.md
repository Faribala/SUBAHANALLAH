## Deliverables — produce each section in detail:

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance & Assessment
1. Remote survey plan (ROV/AUV selection, sonar mapping, photogrammetry)
2. Radiological survey protocol (water/sediment sampling grid, dosimetry)
3. Structural integrity assessment methodology
4. Seabed geotechnical survey (bearing capacity, sediment coring)
5. Environmental baseline study (flora, fauna, current mapping)

### Phase 2: Engineering Design
1. Lift system architecture — evaluate and select from:
   - Controlled buoyancy (pontoons/ballast tanks)
   - Mechanical lift (crane barges, strand jacks)
   - Hybrid approach
2. Rigging and attachment point design (hull cradle, spreader bars, sling loads)
3. Structural reinforcement plan if hull is compromised
4. Reactor compartment containment strategy (cofferdam, encapsulation)
5. Load path analysis and lift dynamics modeling
6. Contingency for lift abort at each depth stage

### Phase 3: Radiological & Environmental Safety
1. Radiological characterization and hazard classification
2. Containment hierarchy (primary/secondary/tertiary barriers)
3. Personnel dosimetry and ALARA planning
4. Environmental impact assessment and mitigation
5. Emergency response procedures (containment breach, lift failure)
6. Waste management and disposal pathway

### Phase 4: Operational Execution Plan
1. Fleet composition (heavy-lift vessel, support ships, ROV spread, tugs)
2. Personnel requirements (divers, ROV pilots, nuclear engineers, health physicists)
3. Operational sequence with decision gates (go/no-go criteria)
4. Weather window analysis and seasonal planning
5. Communications and command structure
6. Detailed timeline (Gantt chart or milestone schedule)

### Phase 5: Transport & Disposition
1. Wet-tow vs. heavy-lift transport to drydock
2. Receiving facility requirements
3. Reactor defueling and decommissioning sequence
4. Hull dismantlement or preservation plan
5. Final waste disposition and site remediation

### Phase 6: Risk Management
1. Risk register (likelihood × consequence matrix)
2. Top 10 risks with mitigation strategies
3. Insurance and liability framework
4. Regulatory approval pathway and timeline

### Phase 7: Budget Estimate
1. Cost breakdown structure by phase
2. Major cost drivers and sensitivity analysis
3. Historical cost benchmarks (e.g., Kursk, K-27, CIA Azorian)

## Constraints
- Prioritize nuclear safety above schedule and cost at all times
- Comply with IAEA safety standards (GSR Part 3, SSR-5)
- Assume no military classification restrictions unless stated
- Design for a realistic technology readiness level (TRL ≥ 6)

## Format
- Use clear section headers and numbered items
- Include diagrams/tables where they add clarity (describe them textually)
- Flag assumptions explicitly
- Cite historical precedents (Project Azorian, Kursk salvage, K-159, Ehime Maru)
- Provide decision trees for critical branch points
